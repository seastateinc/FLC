# Changes this week
We have updated the blue king crab totals to reflect the crab calendar year season start and end dates of July-1 to June-30, respectively.  All blue crab reported for the current calendar year reflect the numbers caught since July 1, 2016.  â€“Steve




### Overview
```{R,HalibutDMR}
	h1 <- OverviewTable[1,1]
	h2 <- OverviewTable[1,2]

	delta <- (h2-h1)/h1
```

The total cumulative catch of Pacific cod at the end of `r Period$eow` was `r prettyNum(round(OverviewTable[2,2]),big.mark=",")` mt.  At the same week in the previous year, the cumulative catch was `r prettyNum(round(OverviewTable[2,1]),big.mark=",")` mt (Table 1). Halibut encounters to date have `r ifelse(delta < 0,"decreased","increased")` by `r percent(abs(delta))` over last year.  The cumulative halibut mortality to date for `r year(today())` is `r prettyNum(round(OverviewTable[5,2]),big.mark=",")` mt, and at the same time last year `r prettyNum(round(OverviewTable[5,1]),big.mark=",")` mt.


```{R,OverviewTable}
	library(pander)
  panderOptions('digits', 2)
  panderOptions('round', 2)
  panderOptions('keep.trailing.zeros', TRUE)
  panderOptions('big.mark', ",")
  panderOptions('keep.line.breaks', TRUE)
  pander(x=OverviewTable, 
  	caption=paste0("Catch statistics (in metric tons) for week ending ",Period$eow," (Week ", .WEEK, ")."),justify='right')
```


```{R,codCatch,fig.margin = FALSE,fig.cap="Weekly catch of Pacific cod, and encounters (mt) of Pacific Halibut."}
	G2 + theme_bw(base_size=10)
```



### NMFS Stat Area Summary
```{R,catchSummary}
	library(pander)
  panderOptions('digits', 2)
  panderOptions('round', 2)
  panderOptions('table.style','multiline')
  panderOptions('keep.trailing.zeros', TRUE)
  panderOptions('big.mark', ",")
  #pander(x=statAreaRates, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, caption=paste0("Halibut encounter rates for the week ending ",Period$eow,"."),justify='right')
  pander(x=sar_Table, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, caption=paste0("Halibut encounter rates for the week ending ",Period$eow,"."),justify='right')
```



### Vessel Rates and Ranking
```{R,vesselRates}
	pander(vesselRates,
					keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
					justify=c('center','left','center','center'),
					caption=paste0("Vessel rates in kg of halibut per ton of groundfish for the week ending ",Period$eow, "."),
					split.cells=c(10,290,15,15))
```




### Viability Sampling
Total number of hauls sampled to date is 
`r prettyNum(NumberOfHaulsSampled[2,2],big.mark=",")`, and the total number of hauls sampled in `r NumberOfHaulsSampled[1,1]` was `r prettyNum(NumberOfHaulsSampled[1,2],big.mark=",")`.

```{R,ViabilitySummary}
	library(pander)
  panderOptions('digits', 2)
  panderOptions('round', 2)
  panderOptions('keep.trailing.zeros', TRUE)
	
	today = .TODAY-1
	set.caption(paste("Viability samples as of",today), permanent = FALSE)
	pander(TBL_1)
```



### Discard Mortality Rates (DMR)

The `r year(.TODAY)` discard mortality rate based on all viability samples (Table 4) to date is `r dmr[1,2]` for trips targeting `r dmr[1,1]` (Table 5), and `r dmr[2,2]` for trips targeting `r dmr[2,1]`.

```{R,DMR_Table}
	library(pander)
	pander(dmr,
				 	keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
				 	caption="Halibut discard mortality rates based on viability sampling.")
```

### Blue King Crab 

```{R,BlueKingCrab}
	source("FLC_bkc.R")
```
**NOTE** The calanedar year for Blue King Crab starts on July 1st of each year. Counts in each table reflect the crab calendar year. 

Total cumulative catch of blue king crab in `r .YEAR[2]` is `r sum(tbl[,4],na.rm=TRUE)`. At the same time last year the total cumulative catch was `r sum(tbl[,3],na.rm=TRUE)`.

```{R,BKC_tbl}	
	#pander(bkc_Table)
	colnames(tbl) <- c("Reporting\nArea",
											"Total\n2015",
											"Year\nto\ndate\n2015",
											"Year\nto\ndate\n2016",
											paste("Week ",.WEEK,"\n2015"),
											paste("Week ",.WEEK,"\n2016")
											)
	pander(tbl,missing="?",caption="Blue king crab numbers by NMFS stat area.")
```

```{R,BKC_atbl}	
	atbl <- cbind(area=c("Total","PHCZ","BKCD"),atbl)
	colnames(atbl) <- c("Reporting\nArea",
											"Total\n2015",
											"Year\nto\ndate\n2015",
											"Year\nto\ndate\n2016",
											paste("Week ",.WEEK,"\n2015"),
											paste("Week ",.WEEK,"\n2016")
											)
	pander(atbl,missing="?",caption="Total blue king crab numbers, numbers taken inside the Pribilof Habitat Conservation Zone, and the Blue King Crab District.")
```




### Sea Birds


**NOTE**: Work in progress.  I'm still need to validate these numbers with the regional office. Stay tuned.  
```{R,Birds}
	source("FLC_SeaBirds.R")
	pander(tbl.2)
```

Show a table with the breakdown of BSAI groundfish catch & bycatch by gear types: HAL, NPT, POT, PTR, ALL.



### Halibut hotspots
Heat map based on the halibut encounter rates in the H\&L CP fishery.

How this will eventually work, I'm just calculating the nearest neighbor density for all sets in the past week where the halibut encounter rate is greather than the median rate of all sets for that week.  For now the rate is based on (kg Halibut pre mortality)/(Official Total Catch)

```{R,fig.width=4,fig.height=4}
	#bmap
```
