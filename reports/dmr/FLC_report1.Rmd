### Overview
```{R,HalibutDMR}
	h1 <- OverviewTable[1,1]
	h2 <- OverviewTable[1,2]

	delta <- (h2-h1)/h1
```

The total cumulative catch of Pacific cod at the end of `r Period$eow` was `r prettyNum(round(OverviewTable[2,2]),big.mark=",")` mt.  At the same week in the previous year, the cumulative catch was `r prettyNum(round(OverviewTable[2,1]),big.mark=",")` mt (Table 1). Halibut catch to date has `r ifelse(delta < 0,"decreased","increased")` by `r percent(abs(delta))` over last year.  


```{R,OverviewTable}
	library(pander)
  panderOptions('digits', 2)
  panderOptions('round', 2)
  panderOptions('keep.trailing.zeros', TRUE)
  panderOptions('big.mark', ",")
  panderOptions('keep.line.breaks', TRUE)
  pander(x=OverviewTable, 
  	caption=paste0("Catch statistics for week ending ",Period$eow," (Week ", .WEEK, ")."),justify='right')
```


```{R,codCatch,fig.margin = FALSE}
	G2 + theme_bw(base_size=10)
```



### NMFS Stat Area Summary
```{R,catchSummary}
	library(pander)
  panderOptions('digits', 2)
  panderOptions('round', 2)
  panderOptions('keep.trailing.zeros', TRUE)
  panderOptions('big.mark', ",")
  pander(x=statAreaRates, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, caption=paste0("Halibut encounter rates for the week ending ",Period$eow,"."),justify='right')
```



### Vessel Rates and Ranking
```{R,vesselRates}
	pander(vesselRates,
					keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
					justify=c('center','left','center','center'),
					caption=paste0("Vessel rates in kg of halibut per ton of groundfish for the week ending ",Period$eow, "."),
					split.cells=c(10,290,15,15))
```




### Viability Sampling
Total number of hauls sampled to date is 
`r prettyNum(NumberOfHaulsSampled[2,2],big.mark=",")`, and the total number of hauls sampled in `r NumberOfHaulsSampled[1,1]` was `r prettyNum(NumberOfHaulsSampled[1,2],big.mark=",")`.

```{R,ViabilitySummary}
	library(pander)
  panderOptions('digits', 2)
  panderOptions('round', 2)
  panderOptions('keep.trailing.zeros', TRUE)
	
	today = .TODAY-1
	set.caption(paste("Viability samples as of",today), permanent = FALSE)
	pander(TBL_1)
```



### Discard Mortality Rates (DMR)

The `r year(.TODAY)` discard mortality rate based on all viability samples (Table 4) to date is `r dmr[1,2]` for trips targeting `r dmr[1,1]` (Table 5), and `r dmr[2,2]` for trips targeting `r dmr[2,1]`.

```{R,DMR_Table}
	library(pander)
	pander(dmr,
				 	keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
				 	caption="Halibut discard mortality rates based on viability sampling.")
```
<!-- 
### Catch-to-date by gear type.
Show a table with the breakdown of BSAI groundfish catch & bycatch by gear types: HAL, NPT, POT, PTR, ALL.

### Blue King Crab
Show BKC catch-to-date by fishing area, and report the number caught in the Prib's Zone.  Simple table will suffice.


### Halibut hotspots
Heat map based on the halibut encounter rates in the H\&L CP fishery.

How this will eventually work, I'm just calculating the nearest neighbor density for all sets in the past week where the halibut encounter rate is greather than the median rate of all sets for that week.  For now the rate is based on (kg Halibut pre mortality)/(Official Total Catch)

```{R,fig.width=4,fig.height=4}
